 * returned `"commands":[]`. The engine downgraded the turn to a clarification, so the user read "shall I do X?"
 * while no pending action existed and no confirm channel was open. The wording was never the problem — the
 * command envelope was missing — so the engine asks the constructor once more, with an explicit either/or, and
 * only downgrades when that round fails too.
